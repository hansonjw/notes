## When to Use Markdown:
After knowing the many benefits of Markdown, you might want to consider using Markdown if you ever find yourself in any of these scenarios:

+ The only editor available to you supports just plain text.
+ Time is of the essence and you canâ€™t afford to learn how to use an unfamiliar rich-text editor.
+ You need to quickly outline your ideas in a structured but presentable manner.
+ You want your document to be portable so that it can convert to HTML, PDF, EPUB, and/or MOBI.
